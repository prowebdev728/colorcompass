	<p>The new BC Color Compass training centre is now complete with training already underway at the Coquitlam office. As a group Color Compass now has four training centres in Western Canada, far beyond what any other distributor can provide the industry.</p>
	<p>The newly minted facility features a 3,400 square foot technical area complete with a Global Ultra advanced down draft spray booth, the Nitro Heat spray system, hip blowers, 15000 CFM AMU , and an 8 x8 prep deck for test panels and smaller training scenarios. On the way is a Car-O-Liner Quick 42 mobile rack, Pro Spot i5 resistance welder, Pro Spot SP- 5 Multi welder, Wedge Clamp Eclipse measuring system, and the Wedge Clamp Nitro Plastic Nitrogen Welder. The centre is also equipped with the full line of BETAG Innovation products.</p>
	<p>The modern Color Compass University classroom area is also complete and has full audio and visual capabilities to enable a more interactive training environment. The room can hold a total capacity of more than 30 students and has four multi-use offices for manufacturers and trainers alike. Finishing the room is new laminate wood flooring, small coffee bar area, and a fresh coat of paint.</p>
	<p>To open the training centre we welcomed BETAG Innovation as well as over 40 staff, estimators, and facility managers in for four days of segmented in-class and technical training. The training session was in conjunction with the BMW approval of the BETAG equipment for small-damage repair. The four days comprised of an in-class estimator course, as well as technical small-damage repair training where attendees were able to get their hands on the full BETAG system.</p>
	<p>Betag Innovation is based in Switzerland and has been working with Color Compass to bring their repair solutions to Canada. Much like Color Compass, BETAG realizes success lies in a well-trained industry. According to BETAG, while the company does manufacture the equipment they sell, the focus is always on training techs to perform higher quality and more efficient repairs using that equipment. "We focus on upskilling," they say. "Training is a really big part of what we do. We want to teach technicians to perform higher quality repairs as well as producing the tools that allow them to do that." The Betag small damage repair and medium panel repair programs that are facilitated at Color Compass are specifically designed for BMW, and the programs are all part of the current BMW North America Group University curriculum.</p>
