	<p>Carlson and Chase put Color Compass on the map in Saskatchewan recently with two New Product Showcase events in Saskatoon and Regina. The events took place Tuesday March 21st and Thursday March 23rd  at Saskatchewan Polytechnicâ€™s Saskatoon and Regina campuses.</p>
	<p>There was a concentration on live demonstrations, giving repairers in Saskatchewan the opportunity to get their hands on some of the latest products and services available all under one roof. The events also served as a good chance to network directly with manufacturers' representatives. The enthusiasm from the industry was clear with some attendees driving over three hours each way to attend. Door prizes were also up for grabs at both events with the winners in Saskatoon being; Sandberg Collision, North Battleford Campbell's Auto Body, Wydena, and Magic Paint &amp; Body, Saskatoon.</p>
	<p>The events differed from previous Color Compass shows in Saskatchewan by expanding the representation of manufacturers. The increased level of participation from leading manufacturers has continued to grow at a very encouraging rate and shows that when partnered with Color Compass, leading manufacturers see the value!</p>
	<p>Kelly Hackman, Sales Manager with Carlson Body Shop Supply in Saskatchewan summed up the events.</p>
	<p>"On behalf of Color Compass Corporation (Carlson Body Shop Supply and Chase Auto Body Supplies), we would like to extend our thanks to everyone who was able to attend our shows in Saskatoon and Regina," he says. "The well-attended events only go to prove that the collision centres in Saskatchewan are engaged and will continue to grow with the collision industry as change occurs. These events were a unique opportunity for the collision centres of Saskatchewan to network with the industry's leading manufacturers and representatives without the burden of extensive travel. Color Compass Corporation is focused on the Saskatchewan marketplace, and will continue to partner with the leading strategic players that the industry has to offer."</p>
	<p>Approximately 75 industry stakeholders attended the event in Saskatoon, with an additional 100 or so repairers attending in Regina. </p>
	<p>The New Products Showcases featured the latest on 3-D measuring, digital marketing programs, nitrogen welding, small dent repair and more. Exhibiting manufacturers included Pro-Spot, Car-O-Liner, BETAG, Wedge Clamp, 3M, Pure Auto Digital Marketing, Kent Automotive, Prestige Chemical, DuraShield, CPS, Farecla, Booth Brothers and many more.</p>
