	<p>The introduction to the Car-O-Liner equipment line also comes as we introduce Blaine Fraser as the Color Compass Car-O-Liner and BETAG Equipment specialist. Blaine will be tasked with supporting the sales, installation, and training efforts of both the BETAG line of products as well as Car-O-Liner. Blaine was previously in sales with Carlson Body Shop Supply and has a deep understanding of the modern Collision Repair facility. With our growing repair equipment range of products along with the equipment specialist team, and our soon to be four training centres, we're ready to support our customers in the fast-paced industry. </p>
